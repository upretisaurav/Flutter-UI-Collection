### Sunseek UI
This UI design is inspired by the work of Igor Savelev. You can find the original design here: [SunSeek Onboarding Flow](https://dribbble.com/shots/25461993-Onboarding-Flow-for-SunSeek-Streamlined-User-Journey-for-Health)
This is a clone implementation of Igor's SunSeek onboarding flow design, which features an elegant user journey for health-focused applications.
