# Podcast App UI - Flutter

This project is a Flutter-based practice project where I replicated the UI design of a podcast app inspired by a design from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/24316041-Podcast-mobile-version). The goal of this project was to practice my Flutter UI development skills by creating a pixel-perfect replica of the provided design.
